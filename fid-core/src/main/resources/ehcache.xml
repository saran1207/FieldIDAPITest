    Cache configuration
    ===================

    The following attributes are required.

    name:
    Sets the name of the cache. This is used to identify the cache. It must be unique.

    maxElementsInMemory:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be created in memory.  0 = no limit.
    In practice no limit means Integer.MAX_SIZE (2147483647) unless the cache is distributed
    with a Terracotta server in which case it is limited by resources.

    maxElementsOnDisk:
    Sets the maximum number of objects that will be maintained in the DiskStore
    The default value is zero, meaning unlimited.

    eternal:
    Sets whether elements are eternal. If eternal,  timeouts are ignored and the
    element is never expired.

    overflowToDisk:
    Sets whether elements can overflow to disk when the memory store
    has reached the maxInMemory limit.

    The following attributes and elements are optional.

    overflowToOffHeap:
    (boolean) This feature is available only in enterprise versions of Ehcache.
    When set to true, enables the cache to utilize off-heap memory
    storage to improve performance. Off-heap memory is not subject to Java
    GC. The default value is false.
    
    maxMemoryOffHeap:
    (string) This feature is available only in enterprise versions of Ehcache.
    Sets the amount of off-heap memory available to the cache.
    This attribute's values are given as <number>k|K|m|M|g|G|t|T for
    kilobytes (k|K), megabytes (m|M), gigabytes (g|G), or terabytes
    (t|T). For example, maxMemoryOffHeap="2g" allots 2 gigabytes to
    off-heap memory.

    This setting is in effect only if overflowToOffHeap is true.

    Note that it is recommended to set maxElementsInMemory to at least 100 elements
    when using an off-heap store, otherwise performance will be seriously degraded,
    and a warning will be logged.

    The minimum amount that can be allocated is 128MB. There is no maximum.

    timeToIdleSeconds:
    Sets the time to idle for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum amount of time between accesses before an element expires
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that an Element can idle for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    timeToLiveSeconds:
    Sets the time to live for an element before it expires.
    i.e. The maximum time between creation time and when an element expires.
    Is only used if the element is not eternal.
    Optional attribute. A value of 0 means that and Element can live for infinity.
    The default value is 0.

    diskPersistent:
    Whether the disk store persists between restarts of the Virtual Machine.
    The default value is false.

    diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds:
    The number of seconds between runs of the disk expiry thread. The default value
    is 120 seconds.

    diskSpoolBufferSizeMB:
    This is the size to allocate the DiskStore for a spool buffer. Writes are made
    to this area and then asynchronously written to disk. The default size is 30MB.
    Each spool buffer is used only by its cache. If you get OutOfMemory errors consider
    lowering this value. To improve DiskStore performance consider increasing it. Trace level
    logging in the DiskStore will show if put back ups are occurring.

    clearOnFlush:
    whether the MemoryStore should be cleared when flush() is called on the cache.
    By default, this is true i.e. the MemoryStore is cleared.

    statistics:
    Whether to collect statistics. Note that this should be turned on if you are using
    the Ehcache Monitor. By default statistics is turned off to favour raw performance.
    To enable set statistics="true"

    memoryStoreEvictionPolicy:
    Policy would be enforced upon reaching the maxElementsInMemory limit. Default
    policy is Least Recently Used (specified as LRU). Other policies available -
    First In First Out (specified as FIFO) and Less Frequently Used
    (specified as LFU)

    copyOnRead:
    Whether an Element is copied when being read from a cache.
    By default this is false.

    copyOnWrite:
    Whether an Element is copied when being added to the cache.
    By default this is false.

    Cache elements can also contain sub elements which take the same format of a factory class
    and properties. Defined sub-elements are:

    * cacheEventListenerFactory - Enables registration of listeners for cache events, such as
      put, remove, update, and expire.

    * bootstrapCacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a BootstrapCacheLoader, which is called by a
      cache on initialisation to prepopulate itself.

    * cacheExtensionFactory - Specifies a CacheExtension, a generic mechanism to tie a class
      which holds a reference to a cache to the cache lifecycle.

    * cacheExceptionHandlerFactory - Specifies a CacheExceptionHandler, which is called when
      cache exceptions occur.

    * cacheLoaderFactory - Specifies a CacheLoader, which can be used both asynchronously and
      synchronously to load objects into a cache. More than one cacheLoaderFactory element
      can be added, in which case the loaders form a chain which are executed in order. If a
      loader returns null, the next in chain is called.

    * copyStrategy - Specifies a fully qualified class which implements
      net.sf.ehcache.store.compound.CopyStrategy. This strategy will be used for copyOnRead
      and copyOnWrite in place of the default which is serialization.
