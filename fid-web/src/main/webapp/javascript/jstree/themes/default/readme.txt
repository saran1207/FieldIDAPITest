Since there were only a few custom changes, the styles were added to the plugin's default.css file.  The Default backup has not been changed for reference.

The new custom changes are at the bottom of default.css and the changes to the existing CSS are commented out with the new value beside it. Also, the sprite image used for the Field ID styles are originally in the Classic theme.
